Hussein: As we were kind of a milestone behind, I was mostly working on milestone 1. Creating walls that the player and enemies cannot move through. I also
dedicated a good amount of time trying to make the code that mainly depended on static variables to be static free. That alone, has led to many different 
bugs and issues with the code and calling functions and methods.
